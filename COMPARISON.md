# Comparison with Similar Tools

## DeathToDSStore

A similar tool called "DeathToDSStore" exists as a Homebrew cask, but it has been discontinued upstream and disabled in Homebrew as of December 16, 2024. Unlike our `rmds` command-line utility, DeathToDSStore was a GUI application.

Key differences:
- `rmds` is an active, maintained command-line utility
- `rmds` is more suitable for scripting and automation
- `rmds` works on-demand rather than monitoring the filesystem continuously
- `rmds` has no GUI dependencies
- `rmds` has verbose output option to show which files are being removed
- `rmds` reports a count of removed files

## Alternatives

### Using find directly
```bash
find . -name ".DS_Store" -type f -delete
```
This is essentially what `rmds` does under the hood, but `rmds` provides:
- A simpler, memorable command
- User-friendly help and options
- Progress reporting
- Count of removed files
- Man page documentation

### Using git to exclude .DS_Store
```bash
echo ".DS_Store" >> .gitignore
```
This only prevents Git from tracking .DS_Store files but doesn't remove them from the filesystem.

### Using GUI apps
Various GUI applications exist to manage .DS_Store files but they typically:
- Require manual intervention (not scriptable)
- Have dependencies on GUI frameworks
- Often include additional functionality you may not need
- May not be actively maintained

## Why rmds?

`rmds` provides a focused, command-line solution for a common problem facing macOS users. Its simplicity, scriptability, and active maintenance make it an ideal candidate for inclusion in Homebrew core.
